# Dig-Dug-Unity-demo

This is my first project in Unity, featuring level 1 of Dig Dug.

## Controls
I've taken inspiration for the controls from online emulators. 

### Movement
- Arrow keys are the ideal controls for movement, though a, w, s, d keys also work.

### Attack
- You can use either the 'z' or 'x' keys for attacking.
